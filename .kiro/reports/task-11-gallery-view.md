## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript

```

### Data Flow
1. Gallery loads artworks from localStorage via ArtStorage
2. Filters applied in real-time
3. Stats updated when artworks are added/removed
4. Changes persist immediately to localStorage

### Key Features

2. **Detail View**: Full-size image with metadata and actions
3. **Filtering**: Quick access to different artwork categories
4. **Actions**: Like, favorite, delete operations
5. **Statistics**: Real-time counts for better user engagement

## User Interface

### Start Screen

- Sticky header with title and filters
- Responsive grid layout

### Artwork Details

## Testing Notes
